                    <p class="mb-4 para-2"><span class="myDropcap">G</span>abriele Viglietti imported the first Oliomio olive press from Italy to South Africa in 1997.
                        On a small holding outside Stellenbosch, his father-in-law Harry Hands had planted a couple hundred olive trees,
                        after being stationed in Tuscany during World War 2. For the first time in over forty years,
                        olive oil was produced on the farm. Since that first oil in 1997, Gabriele and his son Piero,
                        have produced olive oil for the past two decades and have a loyal following among family and friends.
                            Like many delicious, artisanal Italian products, olive oil is to be shared over a meal with family and friends.
                            We hope you enjoy yours â€“ with saluti, greetings from our family to yours.</p>
